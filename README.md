### Innovative imaging technology selection
Through the smooth lines in the original picture and the figures on the bridge from far to near, one can imagine a dynamic sky and figures in circulation. Therefore, this creative image technology from the Van Gogh Art Exhibition more closely extends the original painting of "The Scream", which can change the static lines of different colors and areas under the guidance of the mouse or other interactive functions to generate new image elements or extensions.
