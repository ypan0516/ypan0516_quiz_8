## major project artwork choosing: Edvard Munch - 'The Scream'
The artwork I have chosen for my major project is 'The Scream' by Edvard Munch. Through the flowing lines in the painting, the distant background of the characters on the trestle and the nearby main characters, we can conceive a dynamic sky and the creativity of the characters.
